    "text": "On Friday, March 10th, 2023, U.S. regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. The 40-year-long bank operation suddenly stopped after depositors panicked when learning that the bank was short on capital. The bank found itself in this position due to several factors, including incorrect investment allocation and customers requiring to use more cash in the bank as Venture Capital firms cut back their funding (Vanian 2023). The public quickly turned its attention to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC is an independent government agency tasked with insuring deposits, supervising financial institutions, and dealing with the orderly management of a bank failure. Most famously, the FDIC provides a standard insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, which has accomplished for no depositor to lose a penny of insured funds due to a failure since 1934 (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 2020). The case of the FDIC showcased just one of the fascinating aspects of the U.S. banking system that was largely unknown to the general public. It also inspired us to carry out this project. With it, we aim to inform our audience of several distinguishing facts about the U.S. banking system."

    "text": "What does it mean for money to “be” somewhere?\nLet us clarify that your money is actually stored as bits in bank-operated servers. Each bank needs to maintain records of their customer’s accounts, so multiple copies of this data may be stored across different servers. That is where your money actually is, but that is not very interesting. In this project, we will refer to money being where the bank is. However, that leads to a second question: What does it mean for a bank to be somewhere? Is it where the headquarters are? Is it where the executives work? Is it where most of its branches are? We adopt the Federal Reserve’s definition of a bank’s location: its main office as listed in the bank’s charter (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2022).\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n1992-12-31\n        \n        2002-12-31\n        \n        2012-12-31\n        \n        2022-12-31\n        \n        \n\n\n\n\nFigure 2"

I am particularly interested in economic research, sports data, and environmental causes. abb110@georgetown.edu\n\n\nJordan Rinaldi\n I am in the 5-year combined/accelerated program at DSAN, meaning that I am currently an undergraduate senior at Georgetown who is also taking graduate classes. I am majoring in math and double minoring in economics and government. I hope to enter the field of data science and analytics, preferably on the more data side of the industry. jar388@georgetown.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaunak Advani\n I’m currently a senior at Georgetown University completing my undergraduate degree in Economics with a minor in Psychology. I’m currently enrolled in Georgetown’s Accelerated BA/MS DSAN program, which means that I will complete both my BA in Economics and MS in DSAN in 5 years. Originally from Mumbai, India, I first come to the United States to attend boarding school in Connecticut after finishing my 10th grade back home. ra1113@georgetown.edu\n\n\nVictor De Lima\n I am a currently a first year student at the MS in Data Science and Analytics program. I am very interested in how machine learning models work. I want to play a part in how these models can be made better and smarter. I am hoping to lay a strong foundation for this during my time at the DSAN program. Some of my other interests are science in general, physics, technology, traveling, and history. I also love programming. vad49@georgetown.edu"

In this study, we focus on historical financial information. The FDIC API offers a comprehensive menu of fields covering all the previously mentioned topics, from financial ratios, income and balance sheet data, bank structure information, and more (field list available here).\nEven though the website offers a query and CSV-download user interface, we constructed our own Python API client to make the process faster (available here). The client uses the Python requests library to bring in the API’s json response, where function get_all_financial_reporting_data() processes the endpoint, reporting period, fields, and result_limit as required.\nWe then collected the quarterly financial information for all insured banks from Q1 1992 to Q4 2022 (30 years). The data is available here. Next, we cleaned the data to combine the 30 years’ worth of data, which totaled 1,014,549 rows.
