There was then a subset of requirements as to what to do with the data but our topic was open ended.\nMy group focused on how Redditors discuss music, our work can be found here. I primarily focused on the genre based analysis as well as authoring much of our written segments.\n\n\nSkills Developed and Tools Used\n\nPython\nAWS\n\nSagemaker\nS3 Storage\nLambda\n\nAzure\n\nMachine Learning\nBlob Storage\n\nApache Spark\nPyspark\nDuckDB\nPolars\nDocker\nGithub"
