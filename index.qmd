## About

![](./images/headshot.JPG){width=50% fig-alt="Me" fig-align="center"}

Hi! My name is Austin. I am an Equity Research Associate at [M Science](https://www.mscience.com/) covering Restaurants and AAPL. My primary focus is on DPZ, WEN, QSR, and PZZA. I currently live in the East Village in New York City. There, I spend my free time exploring local restaurants, going to the gym, and watching sports.Namely, I am a fan of the Denver Broncos, Georgetown Hoyas, and your 2023 NBA Champion Denver Nuggets. When I get the chance, I also love to ski.

I finished my latest education in May 2024, receiving a Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics from Georgetown University. In my graduate studies, I focused on Deep Learning, Large Language Models/NLP, and Network Analysis. You can read more on my coursework on the [coursework page](./coursework.qmd). I also completed my undergraduate studies at Georgetown, graduating in 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Philosophy. In undergrad, I was a four year member and director of membership for the [Georgetown University Eating Society (GUES)](https://www.gueatingsociety.com/) and [Sports Writer for The Hoya](https://thehoya.com/staff_name/austin-barish/). My sports coverage took me as far as Indianapolis for the 2021 March Madness Tournament. I remain a fan of the Georgetown Hoyas, particularly the Men's basketball team, despite their ongoing struggles.
